# FashionCommerce
A robust, scalable e-commerce platform built with Core Java, Advanced Java, JSP, JDBC, SQL, and MySQL — designed
to simulate real-world shopping and admin experiences.

Project Overview

Admin Module
Secure login authentication
Add/Edit/Delete Products
Category and Brand Management

User Module
User Registration & Login
Product Browsing by Category & Brand
Add to Cart & Checkout Functionality

Key Highlights
Developed using Core & Advanced Java, applying OOP concepts, Servlets, and JSP for dynamic page rendering
Used JDBC for database connectivity and MySQL for data persistence
Designed efficient SQL schemas for handling products, users, orders, and inventory
Implemented validation and error-handling mechanisms for a smooth user experience

Skills Strengthened
Java Backend Development (JSP, JDBC, Servlets)
SQL Query Design & Database Modeling
MVC Architecture & Web Application Logic
End-to-End Debugging and Testing Practices

In Progress: Spring Boot Version
I delayed this release because I’ve also been actively working on a modernized version of this application using Spring, 
Spring Boot, and REST APIs. The upgraded version will include:
RESTful architecture
Spring Data JPA
Improved security with Spring Security
Better scalability and modular design.
